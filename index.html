    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <hr/>
    <div id="profile">Computer Engineer currently working in the domain of SAP Cloud Technical Consultant in Tata Consultancy Services. <br/>
    I am having more than 3 years of experience as an SAP Basis Consultant, and have built, integrated and deployed different types of solutions such as Web Dispatchers, Cloud Connectors, 
    OpenText Solutions, Convergents Charding solutions etc. over the cloud. <br/>
    I was always interested in coding and building softwares, websites etc. but did not get the opportunity to get my hands on it, since I was deployed in a more business oriented functional domain in SAP project.
    Now I am concentrating more into learning web Development and building websites and stuff like that.
    Having said that, I have production level experience in SAP BASIS project and am always willing to educate someone who wants to understand SAP Basis.
