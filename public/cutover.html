    <h2><center>NUMBER OF CUTOVERS COMPLETED</center></h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>Usually all the solutions that we had to build as an expert Cloud Technical Consultant were given with a standard timeline based on its delivery.
        Some solutions were given 3 days, some 4, etc. But whenever the customers wanted their requested systems to be delivered according to their timeline, then those systems had to be build based on the timelines given by them. Usually It would be around 12 - 14 hours.
        And so it was expected by them that the agreed solution be build and delivered it for production use by the agreed timeline.
        <br/> <br/>
        This required a lot of knowledge and time Management since the solutions which are normally given 2-3 days are to be delivered within 12-14 hours.
        I had done around 20 of these kinds of system deliveries, where for instance, I had worked for around 27.5 hours non-stop without break to deliver a really customer critical system.
